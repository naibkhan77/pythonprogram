# Adding Whitespace to Strings with Tabs or Newlines

# To add a tab to your text, use the character combination \t

# print("python")

# print("\tpython")

#  To add a newline in a string, use the character combination \n:

# print("Language: \nPython\nC\nJavaScript")

# 

# print("Language:\nPython\nC\n\tJavaScript")

# 

#  Stripping Whitespace //  strip() method:

# name = " Python "
# print(name.strip()) # remve space from both

# name = "python "
# print(name.rstrip())  # remove space from right
# print(name.lstrip())  # remove space from left

# 
# Bonus: Stripping specific characters

# text = "--Hello--"
# print(text.strip("-")) # "Hello"
